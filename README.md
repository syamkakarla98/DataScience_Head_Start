  * Finally, Little Bit of StatisticsüòÖ

#### Let's Start
* [Stackoverflow Developer Survey Analysis](https://github.com/syamkakarla98/DataScience_Head_Start/blob/master/Sackoverflow_Developer_Survey_Analysis.ipynb) - Begginer data analysis on the stackoverflow developer survey 2019. It also includes few questions that are needed to be answered by analysing the data.

* [UFO Sightings](https://github.com/syamkakarla98/DataScience_Head_Start/blob/master/UFO_Sightings.ipynb) - Data analysis on the UFO sightings dataset. It includes the analysis of the attributes, Visualizations, finding insights from the analysis of dataset e.t.c. and aslo ends with questions which are answered by analysing data.
