# Deep Learning

**_Deep learning_** is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans ie., learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind :
 * Driverless Cars
 * Enabling them to recognize a stop sign
 * Distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. 
It is the key to **voice control in consumer devices** like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.

In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.

 1. The **convolutional neural networks(CNNs)** has revolutionalised the way of solving the computer vision problems. So, lets solve few problems with realtime data.
